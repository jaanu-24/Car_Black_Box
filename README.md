# Car_Black_Box
 By considering todays busy life, every one wants to reach the destination as soon as
 possible by ignoring the rules and regulations. So one solution could be by implementing a
 Black Box which would log critical activities on the car.
 As mentioned above the root cause of the negligence in the driving would be meeting the
 daily schedule and go off duty, or to earn extra money by illegal trips etc,. So buy
 implementing the mentioned solution it would be easy to keep track of how the vehicle is
 being used, handled and control the efficiency of the vehicle.
 The proposed solution is to log all the critical events like the gear shifts with current speed,
 the engine temperature, fuel consumption per trip, trip distance etc., The system should
 allow a password based access to the transport managers to view or download the log to PC
 if required.
